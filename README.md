# LITA_CLASS_DOCUMENTATION

### Project Title: Data Discovery: Documenting my Analytics Experience

### Project Overview
This project serves as a personal documentation of my journey as I transition into the field of data analysis. It covers my growth from learning fundamental concepts to working with real-world datasets and applying various data analysis techniques.The objective of this project is to track my progress, reflect on key learning milestones, and demonstrate my ability to solve data problems using analytical approaches. It also serves as a resource for those interested in understanding the process of transitioning into data analytics, particularly through self-learning and structured courses.

### Data Sources
The Primary source of Data used is Salary review.xlxs and this is an open source data that can be freely downloaded from an open source online such as kaggle or FRED or any other data repository site.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the Data Cleaning and Preparation section of your documentation, you'll want to list out the common steps you follow to ensure the data is ready for analysis. Here's a structured list of key steps typically involved:
-    Data Importation:
        1. Load the raw data into a suitable environment (e.g., pandas DataFrame). Example: df = pd.read_csv('data.csv').
-    Handling Missing Data:
        1. Identifying missing values: Check for missing or NaN values using methods like isnull() or info().
-    Imputing or removing missing data:
        1. Drop missing values: df.dropna()
        2. Impute missing data (e.g., fill with mean, median, or a constant value): df.fillna(df.mean()).
-    Removing Duplicates:
        1. Identify and remove any duplicate rows or entries.
-    Handling Outliers:
        1. Detecting outliers: Use methods such as box plots or statistical techniques like z-score.
        2. Handling outliers: Remove or cap outliers based on business logic or statistical thresholds.
-    Correcting Inconsistent Data Types:
        1. Convert data types to their appropriate format (e.g., dates to datetime, numerical values to float or int).
